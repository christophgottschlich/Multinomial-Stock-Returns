# Multinomial-Stock-Returns
Master Project at University of Regensburg. We compared several machine learning methods for forecasting multinomial stock returns of the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index.

The Excel file contains the data we used to train our machine learning models. 
We peformed a hyperparameter analysis shown in notebook 1. 
The actual training and testing of the machine learning models is done in Notebook 2.
